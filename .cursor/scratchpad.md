# Grind Quest - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Building a one-page web app for Grind Quest - a gamified social engagement platform for the $GRIND token community. The app will feature a leaderboard system and quest-based rewards for Twitter/X interactions. The design should be clean, minimal, and follow the shadcn/ui aesthetic shown in the reference screenshot.

**UPDATED**: Now integrating with DRIP for enhanced social questing and points management. Using mock authentication for local testing without Twitter OAuth setup. **Comprehensive mock data with realistic posts and full leaderboard.** **NEW: Header navigation with user info and dynamic points updates.** **NEXT: Supabase Realtime with floating heads cursor tracking and live chat for enhanced social interaction.**
